# Correct By Construction

- If you have an instance of something, it is OK.â€‹
- If an instance cannot be created at runtime, it should fail.

This is an implemenation of Correct By Construction that uses modern C++ and is heavily inspired by [C++ Weekly - Ep 134 - The Best Possible Way To Create A Visitor?](https://youtu.be/EsUmnLgz8QY).

It can probably be optimized a lot to use more constexpr and less boilerplate.

This example is heavily inspired by the epic movie Crimson Tide.
